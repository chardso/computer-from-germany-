# computer-from-germany-
An acer perfect machine from R0g to #ASKnet to solve the issue of github documentation.
during the first day ,exitiment almost killed somebody,and the second day ,he started mastering commandline interface and virtual studio code
it was so interesting and funny to work on the germany key board lay out where later y is z and z is y
the whole stuff seemed so hard because he ha not mastered interface command line and virtual studio code.its a very great stuff
